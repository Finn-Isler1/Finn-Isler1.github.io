        <h2>Destination Information</h2>

        <h3>London</h3>

        <p>
            London is a fast-paced city where people generally are friendly but tend to keep to themselves. 
            It’s also full of architecture, iconic music, and food from around the world. The pubs are are incredible and afternoon tea is a must. 
            Pack warm clothing and expect a good deal of rain.
        </p>

        <h3>Liverpool</h3>

        <p>
            Liverpool is a super friendly city where people genuinely love to chat . Being the birthplace of The Beatles, it's soaked in music history. 
            You will find lots live gigs happening on any given night of the week. The accent is charming and the people are full of banter. 
            Football is basically a very big deal here as well.
        </p>

        <h3>Edinburg</h3>

        <p>
            Walking through Edinburgh is like walking through a fantasy novel. It has the castles, the cobbled streets, and of course the bagpipes. 
            It is much more laid-back than London but still has a definite social buzz, especially during the summer festivals. 
            The people here are warm and super polite. Edinburgh also maintains a deep sense of tradition and an appreciation for storytelling and whisky.

            ACT ONE 
            FADE IN: 
            
            
            Short version of scary opening credits (SIMILAR TO LAST 
            YEAR’S HALLOWEEN SHOW) 
            
            
            Camera PANS through the Springfield Cemetery past 
            tombstones which read: ’The Well-Known Soldier’, ‘Jim 
            Morrison’ (a couple of cruddy looking hippies are camped 
            out on the grave),’LP’S’, ‘Rasputin Mad Monk and Loving 
            Husband’, ‘Houdini’ with an open grave and a hand reaching 
            out of it, and ’My other grave is a mausoleum’. 
            EXT. SIMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT 
            KIDS 
            Trick or treat! 
            At the front door, HOMER hands candy out to a bunch of 
            costumed kids including MILHOUSE, who has a deflated 
            balloon with a face on it attached to his shoulder. 
            HOMER 
            Hi kids, here you go... one for you... 
            one for you..(TO MILHOUSE) Who are you 
            supposed to be? 
            MILHOUSE 
            I was a two-headed man before this 
            
            
            balloon popped. Now I’m a one-headed 
            
            
            man. 
            
            
            8F02 TABLE DRAFT 3/13/91 
            
            
            HOMER 
            Well, one for you, and one for the 
            dealer. 
            Homer pops a candy into his mouth and closes the door. 
            INT. SIMPSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
            HOMER (CONT’D) 
            Ooh, I love Halloween... 
            Homer takes the serving bowl back to the couch and 
            continues to shovel down candy as he watches KENT BROCKMAN 
            deliver the news. 
            KENT BROCKMAN 
            And finally, to conclude this Halloween 
            newscast on an appropriate scary note, 
            consider this: (CHUCKLES) The 
            presidential primaries are only a few 
            months away. 
            HOMER 
            Yeah, get a new toupee, laughing boy. 
            
            
            The door bell RINGS. Homer gets up and is greeted by JIMBO 
            and KEARNEY, who aren’t even wearing costumes. 
            
            
            JIMBO & KEARNEY 
            Trick or treat, man. 
            HOMER 
            Aren’t you two a little old for this? 
            And you’re not even wearing costumes. 
            KEARNEY 
            Okay, I’m a hunchback. (LAUGHS) 
            
            
            He pulls up the back of his t-shirt collar over his head. 
            
            
            2.
